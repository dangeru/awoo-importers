|||Should I buy a Chromebook?
||I am a fresh university student with a small budget. I don&#039;t play any games anyway. So should I?
#Depends if you have to run programs for your study. If yes, you need a windows laptop. If no, Chromebooks are pretty nice. Would recommend the Acer ones tbh. Good battery life.
#No.
#no
#Elitist pc gamers will say no but for a university student id say yeah, it&#039;s probably a decent investment
#You&#039;ll regret it later in your final years when you don&#039;t want to do any homework and just want to play vidya all day long to forget the pain of college

#I got once to complement my gaming pc, ended up using it for 99% of my computing. I only log on to my pc to play rust from time to time. Everything else is covered by chromebook/crouton
#What the fuck even is a chromebook?
#you know the chromey texture of an aluminum sheet? wrap a book with it and your done. it keeps your secrets guarded from government spies
