|||Amd or Nvidia?
||Lets start a war,but seriously witch one should someone buy?
#Nvidia, unless you want a very expensive toaster.
#as for me it&#039;s whatever the one store in town has available
#I&#039;d recommend Nvidia almost 100% of the time. Whenever people reach out to amd for optimization they never get back to them.
#I never tried a Nvidia before, but the only thing I can say is that my cpu and gpu are hot as fuck
average temp 56 celsius
#amd btw ^
#&gt;56 celsius
lol hot as fuck

#ayyymd
#&gt;56
hot as fuck lmao
#Hotter than mine which is 88 Celsius ahhahaha
#&gt;88 celsius
fucking kek mate! 
#smh casuals mine is much hotter than that, 48 celsius
#lol my windows 95 is 35 celsius
#Ew amd
#Install Gentoo
#I&#039;m an Amd fag but using Nvidia 
#Nvìdia ftw (￣￣)ーb
#Intel :)))))))
#Amd fan here, but Nvidia&#039;s new 1000 series cards beats whatever AMD has to offer atm. And i needed an upgrade. So logic &gt; fanboy.
#&gt;nvidia&#039;s new 1000 series card beats whatever AMD has to offer atm.

Hope u like virgin thermal paste opposed to superior chad soldering 
#Amd is ass compared to nvidia. I mean look at the performance and heat diffrences cuckboi.
#just get Nvidia already
#I have AMD Radeon 280.
&gt;No fixes that allow me to play Wolfenstein: The old blood without graphical glitches
&gt;couldn&#039;t find a fix to make Dishonored 2 stop lagging so much

buying a GTX 1080 or something next time. But hey, at least my AMD doesn&#039;t really get hot. Most I ever get is about 35 degrees Celsius. Usually it&#039;s at 27 
#&gt;virgin thermal paste 
I chadded my shit up with conductonaut :^) 
#Shit boi u evolved
#Yes gtx1080 is the current best, but people seems to forget that not everyone need the best card... I have no interest in playing resource intensive shooter game. I mostly play rpg and some indie game, that&#039;s why I get the RX470. It can run witcher 3 in 60fps, you just need to turn down some setting (high instead of ultra) and it still looks pretty
#I&#039;ve been using Nvidia under the impression that their Linux drivers are better, but I&#039;m using their proprietary drivers and now I&#039;m hearing that AMDs Linux drivers are better? Hell I dunno man.
#I think that who wants a video card only for playing video games should get an nvidia card, only because their top video cards just perform better than the top amd cards. I must say that if you want to buy a cheap one amd is way better.
#I&#039;d say grab a 1080 or 1070 depending on your budget, if you can maybe try and wait out the Etherium mining craze. Although I don&#039;t see an end in sight. 
#AMD all the way for me
Plays my vidya games just fine and is cheaper
My R9 290 still works extremely well at 1440p

#ayymd.
#FineWine is gonna be amazing with Vega.
#Happy with my r9 380x. Not upgrading anytime soon.
#Doesn&#039;t matter, they&#039;re so close to each other in performance. AMD card will probably last you longer, but NVidia has more gimmicks like GeForce Experience, hairworks, ansel,.. Buy whatever fits your budget.
#AMD&#039;s recent cards have been good for their price.  Only heat trouble I&#039;ve ever had was with an i7 in a laptop.  Upwards of 95C sometimes, and the fan works.
#AMD gpu and Intel cpu
