#Bing? Waitno
#My life is dominated by Google. Like no joke. I have Pixel phone that runs on android. My laptop is a Chromebook, I check my Gmail everyday and watch YouTube on my free time...
#^I know that feel, bro
#i mean, nothing replaces YouTube.. or Google maps, but the rest is.. come on, anon
#Chrome -&gt; Microsoft Edge
Search -&gt; Bing
Youtube-&gt; Rutube
Android-&gt; IOS
Gmail  -&gt; Outlook
Google+-&gt; nah just kidding
#We won&#039;t be in a complete cyberpunk dystopia until we fully accept our Google overlord
#There is no need to search for the alternative, when every major Google service is superior to its rivals (except Google+)
#Chrome &gt; Iridium
Google &gt; DuckDuckGo
YouTube &gt; Is there a replacement yet? 
Android &gt; Android but with a custom rom
Gmail &gt; ProtonMail
Google+ &gt; None, you&#039;re just asking to be doxed
#Regarding DuckDuckGo, it seems to me just like a software relying on privacy-obsessed and that doesn&#039;t excels in anything
#&gt;Edge, Bing, Outlook
there is no point escaping one giant for another duh
#&gt;DuckDuckGo
it does its job as a search engine, and the interface is pretty neat (responsive, etc). it also has infoboxes similar to google&#039;s that lets you do calculation, conversion, definition, etc. the only &#039;downside&#039; to experience is if you also use other google products like maps and gmail which has advanced search functions.
#Chrome &gt; Pale Moon
Google &gt; Startpage
Gmail &gt; Mail.com
YouTube has no alternative. Android is far too superior. I don&#039;t use social media.
