#Nintendo Switch
#I bought PS4 only because it has exclusives, (which i have never ended up playing, except for Until Down which was free game of the month) it is cheaper, has 60 FPS and UI is much simplier than Xbox One&#039;s.
#as an owner of an xbox one, dont get an xbox one. tons of friends switching over to ps4 and are all incredibly happy about that decision. soon will be part of the gang myself
#Ps4 for sure my dude
#i&#039;d say ps4
#Well, since this is in /tech/, in terms of specs I think the XXX(XboX One X) is technically better
#Comes out this year? Not sure, I mean really who cares about the Xbone amirite?
#well if you&#039;re a fuckin casul buy PS4 (or just play on your PC cause why not) and if you&#039;re a cool guy who likes quality products go for the Nintendo consoles 
#Smartphone games ftw
#Pc
#actually as long as you don&#039;t care about exclusives pc would be the best option
#Ps4 just for the exclusives
#Nintendo Switches are so hard to get at list price. They&#039;re like cigarettes in a prison.
#Xbox one always
#they both suck but if anything ps4 for those sweet exclusives
#I&#039;m stuck with my roommates Xbox one just dont
#Pc... Pc master race
