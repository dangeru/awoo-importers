|||Favorite Windows? 
||I like windows 8 it&#039;s slightly faster to me 
#7
#2.1
#Windows 2000 because highest number
#Windows 8 because Madobe Ai is bae
#8.1
#Mac OS
#Windows
#Sliding ones that pop out for ease of cleaning.
#Windows 10...i feel that i am bringing hella big butthurt by saying this. 
#I love hospice ones that can&#039;t open wider than 15 cm. really provoke my suicide tendencies 
#I liked Windows XP for a long time until it just felt too outdated. Now I&#039;m using Win7, which I will probably keep until Microsoft somehow manages to make it unusable.
#The windows that comes with the old lenovo s10e
#&gt;10
Just a little advice windows 10 is a nightmare when it&#039;s about privacy
I mean it even sends data about your Webcam, your motherfucking webcam
#10 also sends sound data it picks up through any microphone. They can hear you fapping or talking about how much you hate &#039;something controversial&#039;.
#Yeeee I&#039;m sticking to 7.
#So those nightmare stories about windows 10 are true?
#They were always true 
Don&#039;t use windows 10 if you care about your privacy, and you should care.
#Windows 9  
#I kinda like Win10. btw you can turn all the information sending bullshit easily off.
#You can&#039;t, that&#039;s just what Micro$oft wants you to think by giving you &quot;yep, this is off now&quot; decoys. Fact is, most of their spyware is hardcoded into crucial system files, for example DLLs. If you really want to turn it all off, you need to convince your ISP to block Micro$oft&#039;s IP addresses.
#who the fuck cares what Microsoft does with my data, I don&#039;t fuckin&#039; care if they see that I jerk off to hentai 24 hours a day
#Why do you even bother yourself about it? If you are not a terrorist or something, why are you so paranoid? 
I would understand the problem if Microsoft started to create 1984-esque government and use absolutely any information against people, but it won&#039;t happen in anyway. 
#Any data the have about you can and will be given to the CIA and FBI if they ask for it. Not sure if I want that, even if all they find is my midget porn. Believe me, they will even find use for that if they have something against you.
#I used 10 once. Was a nightmare. Faster though. But I&#039;m sticking to 7.
#10. I really don&#039;t care about the spying part, I&#039;m sure no matter what Windows we use they still got our smartphones. So I really have to say that I like W10, it&#039;s fast and it looks good design wise.
#It&#039;s already begun, the people don&#039;t care anymore
#I used Win10 for a week. Hated the interface, almost got cancer, went back to Win7.
#I&#039;m trapped in a windows 10 computer right now. Keep hurting myself on all these jagged edge boxes. Better than 8 though, that has a whole page of them.
#Gentoo
#3.11 the best
#Chinese Windows 10 Doesn&#039;t have the botnets
#Windows 10 just happen. I don&#039;t really care about the ui change/compatibility issue/whatever. People would just adapt and move on. And by people I mean app devs and business consumer. No one cares what win 7 hispters think.
#ReactOS obviously ೕ(•̀ᴗ•́)
#I&#039;m a fan of 10&#039;s latest update. It&#039;s just that there&#039;s so much bad with the good
#Windows 10. I&#039;m not too fussed about the spying, it&#039;s not like I have anything to hide. 
#Stained glass. But I think double and triple-glazed windows are a must for winter. 
#Only 7
#7 is my favorite thus far. I&#039;ve been having to use 10 for a bit, and I would stick with it if not for the whole botnet thing. 
#&gt;Stained glass.
This guy knows what&#039;s up. 
#Xp...cuz nostalgia
#if windows 10 had a windows 7 skin, it&#039;d be perfect
#Win95 / MSDos.  It&#039;s super CLEAN
#2k is cute and with glasses.
#3.1 was the last good one
#
#&gt;not using Win7
I tried Win10 for half a year and I got cancer
#
#Using Windows 10 and it&#039;s alright, but I have no mic and no webcam that I can&#039;t remove (and I always remove them when I&#039;m not using them)
Preferred windows 7 tho, felt more sane
#windows 10 is psueperior stop nmeming about owin dows8 7
#8.1 Once you get use to metro is feels fucking great
