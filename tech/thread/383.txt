||When do you suppose we&#039;ll have real advance AI that is akin to a real sentient being? 
To be honest, I&#039;m kind of weary of that day because an AI is going to be infinitely superior to the human mind. They can think and simulate hundreds of lifespans in a matter of what, a week or so maybe? They&#039;ll be able to process things at such a high speed, would we humans even stand a chance?
#could be in 5 years could be in 15 but soon. and no we will be fucked for the most part, but as long as government can keep them in check we should be &#039;ok&#039;. What is more likely to happen soon is a bunch of &quot;dumb&quot; robots take all of our jobs.

#If we&#039;re fucked I hope that it&#039;ll be at least fun to watch. Which it should cause true AI sounds badass af
